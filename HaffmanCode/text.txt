With the gradual popularization of home smart devices, people find that life seems to have become more convenient and easy. Smart furniture or electronic products appearing in almost every family makes to work at home. If necessary, we can even handle all the work without leaving the house, and housework becomes less hard, too. But this trend has more or less triggered a series of discussions: Will the smart life experience brought about by the widespread use of smart devices and abuses make our homes safer?
In my opinion, you can never fully trust a computer, even if it is claimed to be omnipotent. First, home computers have been plagued by computer viruses since the 1990s. Usually designed by hackers who intend to steal important data, computer viruses can spread very fast through the Internet. If your device is connected to the Internet, hackers will easily find your device and infect it, turn it into a spy device, monitor your every move, and even become a Trojan horse for uninvited guests. Secondly, despite many upgrades, the reliability of home smart devices cannot be fully guaranteed. Devices such as monitoring equipment and smart door locks may still fail, which may make it impossible to ensure the safety of the home. In terms of reliability, traditional locks, such as mechanical ones, are still very reliable.
Although we can't fully trust smart devices, the convenience they bring is still not to be ignored. When the problems mentioned above are solved, home smart devices can ensure the safety of the home.
